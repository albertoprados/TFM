A discussion is presented on the effect of cross correlation between the variables affected by uncertainty and the variability of the observed quantities. For this, a simple dipole antenna loaded with a Wu-King profile is analyzed, and the results are validated with the Monte Carlo method.},

@article{Bisheh2015,
abstract = {This paper introduces a new scheme to improve the accuracy of the stochastic finite difference time domain (S-FDTD) method. S-FDTD, reported recently by Smith and Furse, calculates the variations in the electromagnetic fields caused by variability or uncertainty in the electrical properties of the materials in the model. The accuracy of the S-FDTD method is controlled by the approximations for correlation coefficients between the electrical properties of the materials in the model and the fields propagating in them. In this paper, new approximations for these correlation coefficients are obtained using Monte Carlo method with a small number of runs, terming them as Monte Carlo correlation coefficients (MC-CC). Numerical results for two bioelectromagnetic simulation examples demonstrate that MC-CC can improve the accuracy of the S-FDTD method and yield more accurate results than previous approximations.},

@book{Sadiku2009,
abstract = {Until now, novices had to painstakingly dig through the literature to discover how to use Monte Carlo techniques for solving electromagnetic problems. Written by one of the foremost researchers in the field, Monte Carlo Methods for Electromagnetics provides a solid understanding of these methods and their applications in electromagnetic computation. Including much of his own work, the author brings together essential information from several different publications. Using a simple, clear writing style, the author begins with a historical background and review of electromagnetic theory. After addressing probability and statistics, he introduces the finite difference method as well as the fixed and floating random walk Monte Carlo methods. The text then applies the Exodus method to Laplace's and Poisson's equations and presents Monte Carlo techniques for handing Neumann problems. It also deals with whole field computation using the Markov chain, applies Monte Carlo methods to time-varying diffusion problems, and explores wave scattering due to random rough surfaces. The final chapter covers multidimensional integration. Although numerical techniques have become the standard tools for solving practical, complex electromagnetic problems, there is no book currently available that focuses exclusively on Monte Carlo techniques for electromagnetics. Alleviating this problem, this book describes Monte Carlo methods as they are used in the field of electromagnetics.},

We introduce an exact method to control the direction of propagation of a plane wave which can be either a hard source or soft source. Also we show that a simple implementation of a soft source in the Yee algorithm causes an undesired propagation which can result in incorrect answers. To remove this error we suggest a method for different kinds of sources and modes.},

The contour path FDTD method is shown to improve accuracy for incident angles greater than 45 degrees. Results compare well with those obtained using a Monte-Carlo integral equation technique.},

@article{Christ2005,
abstract = {There has been a long and controversial debate on possible differences in electromagnetic (EM) energy absorption between adults and children during cell phone usage. Some published studies report higher specific absorption rate (SAR) in children and explain this based on smaller head size. More recently, age dependent changes of the dielectric tissue parameters have again ignited the discussion. This study intends to give a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge about the parameters and mechanisms affecting the exposure of the mobile phone user with special focus on the exposure of children. Discussed are the absorption mechanism, tissue parameters, the effect of the pinna, and the uncertainties associated with head models based on spheroids, scaled adult heads, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of children. The conclusions of the review do not support the assumption that the energy exposure increases due to smaller heads, but identifies open issues regarding the dielectric tissue parameters and the thickness of the pinna. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
